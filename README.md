GTPB e-Learning

This repository is a state-of-the-art of the eLearning series of experiments held by The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics (GTPB). These experiments were inspired by the [GOBLET/ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Workshop on e-learning](https://github.com/alexcaetano/GTPB_Elearning/blob/master/GOBLET_ELIXIR_Workshop_elearning_SaraPetiz_21112017.pdf) that took place at Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia (IGC).

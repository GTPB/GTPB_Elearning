#**The GTPB e-Learning project**

This repository is a state-of-the-art of the e-learning series of experiments held by The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics (GTPB). 
These experiments were inspired by the [GOBLET/ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Workshop on e-learning](https://github.com/alexcaetano/GTPB_Elearning/blob/master/GOBLET_ELIXIR_Workshop_elearning_SaraPetiz_21112017.pdf) hosted by the GTPB and that took place at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC). 

Currently, we are focusing in the Development phase of the ADDIE Model for Instructional Design, particularly in Building Learning Objects.

##**Building Learning Objects and Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)**##

###Why is it important to develop scorm contents?###
• To be able to reuse contents
• To be able to share contents to other LMS
• To be able to share performance results from participants
